# Stripe Payment Integration in Flutter

### PaymentIntent

In Stripe, a `PaymentIntent` is an object that represents the complete process of collecting a payment from a customer.

It defines the **amount**, **currency**, and the **allowed payment methods**, such as cards, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.

Once the `PaymentIntent` is created on the backend, it is sent to the Flutter client app. The client then uses this intent to build a payment UI, allowing the user to enter their payment details.

The payment submitted by the user is linked directly to the previously created `PaymentIntent`, ensuring the payment is tracked and processed correctly.

### Creating the PaymentIntent on the Server

The first step in the Stripe payment flow is to **create a PaymentIntent**, and this must always be done **on your own backend server**, not in the Flutter (frontend) app.

This is critical because your **Stripe Secret Key** is a sensitive credential and must **never be exposed to the client side**. If someone gains access to this key, they can perform unauthorized charges or misuse your Stripe account.

#### In an ideal setup:

1. Your Flutter app sends a request to your backend (Node.js, Python, Firebase Cloud Functions, etc.).
2. The backend securely uses the **Stripe Secret Key** to create a `PaymentIntent` via Stripe's API.
3. The backend returns the `client_secret` of the `PaymentIntent` to the Flutter app.
4. The Flutter app uses this `client_secret` to complete the payment process through the Stripe SDK.

By doing this, you ensure that:
- The user never sees your Stripe secret key.
- The creation logic is secure and centralized.
- You can perform additional validation or attach metadata during intent creation.

This server-side step is the **foundation of a secure Stripe payment system** and must always precede any client-side logic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never Create a PaymentIntent on the Client Side

In a real-world production app, you should **never create a PaymentIntent directly in the Flutter app**. Doing so would expose your **Stripe Secret Key**, which must always remain confidential.

For this tutorial, the `PaymentIntent` creation is temporarily handled in the frontend **for learning purposes only**. This is **not recommended for production**.

### üõ† Recommended Production Setup with Firebase (or Any Backend)

If you're using a backend like **Firebase**, the proper way is to:

1. Create a **Cloud Function** that stores your Stripe Secret Key securely.
2. Implement the `PaymentIntent` creation logic inside that function using the Stripe SDK.
3. Call this Cloud Function from your Flutter app when you need to initiate a payment.
4. Receive the `client_secret` in the response and use it to trigger the payment flow in your app.

This ensures that your Stripe credentials are safe and that the client cannot manipulate sensitive payment logic.

### üß™ Tutorial Setup (Temporary Frontend Logic)

For the sake of demonstration, we‚Äôre implementing a simplified function directly in Flutter:

- Function Name: `createPaymentIntent`
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: The amount to be charged.
  - `currency`: The currency code (e.g. "usd", "eur").
- Return Type: `Future<String?>` (returns the `client_secret`)

> üîê Reminder: This approach is only suitable for testing and learning. For production, always use a secure backend.

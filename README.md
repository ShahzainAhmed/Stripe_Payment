# Stripe Payment Integration in Flutter

### PaymentIntent: 
In Stripe, a PaymentIntent is an object that represents the entire process of collecting a payment from a customer from start to finish.

It defines the amount to be charged, the currency, and the allowed payment methods through which the user can complete the payment, such as a card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.
